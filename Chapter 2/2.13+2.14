[2.13]What is the value of j in the following program?
int i = 42;
int main()
{
  int i = 100;
  int j = i;  //because i is also defined in-scope, j = 100
}

[2.14]Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?
int i = 100, sum = 0;                       //first i is defined
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)               //second i defined in for loop
sum += i;                                   //sum + i(from for loop) = sum
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;  //the for loop terminated, so the the first i and the value for sum are printed
//The program is legal; output:"100 45"
