[2.1]Difference between:
1.int, long, long long & short?
-The size of values that can be fit into each data type:
 sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long)
2.signed & unsigned types?
-signed types represent negative & positive numbers (& 0), unsigned types
 represent numbers greater than or equal to 0
3.float & double
-Typically floads are represented in one word(32 bits) and yield 7 significant
 digits and doubles in two words(64 bits) and yield 16 significant digits

rate(Zinssatz):           As the interst rate can theoretically be all rational numbers
                          (see: Negative interest on excess reserves for rate below 0%)
                          we can use double (float for weaker machines).                       
principal:                The principal is never less then 0, which means we
(loan size + extra costs) can use an unsigned double (float for weaker machines)     
payment:                  double and float for the same reasons as interst rate
