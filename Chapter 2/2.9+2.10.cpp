/*[2.9]Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;    //error: Uninitialized built-in type

[2.10]What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following
variables?
std::string global_str;   //initialized to empty String defined by string class
int global_int;           //outside a function: initialized to 0 
int main()
{
  int local_int;          //inside a function: undefined
  std::string local_str;  //initialized to empty String
}
