[2.11]Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:
(a) extern int ix = 1024; //definition; extern is overwriten after initialization
(b) int iy;               //definition; extern keyword is missing, so iy is initialized to 0 or undifined
(c) extern int iz;        //declaration
